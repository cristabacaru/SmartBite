Top the hash browns with an egg each, then top with the last slices of toast (spread with more sauce, if you like). Press down lightly on each sandwich and serve as they are or cut in half to get a runny yolk oozing out of each sandwich. Serve with a bowl of baked beans on the side."

The mix will look lumpy and may have the odd fleck of flour still visible, but don\u2019t be tempted to overmix. Tip in the blueberries and give it just one more stir. Divide the mix between the muffin cases \u2013 they will be quite full \u2013 then sprinkle the tops with the final tbsp of the oats and the rest of he sugar. Bake for 18-20 mins until risen and dark golden. Cool for 5 mins in the tray before lifting out onto a rack to cool completely."

Generously brush the sides and tops of the scrolls with the beaten egg. Bake for about 30 mins or 45-50 mins from frozen until golden, bubbling and puffed up. Leave to cool on the baking tray for 15 mins to firm up before serving warm. Will keep chilled in an airtight container for up to two days."

Brush the remaining beaten egg all over the tops and sides of the pastry, then bake for 15-18 mins until golden and risen. Leave to cool on the tray for 10-15 mins.",
