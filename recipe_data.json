Roll one of the balls out on a floured surface into a large circle using a rolling pin, then lift onto a floured baking sheet. Scatter over the toppings of your choice, then carefully slide the pizza from the baking sheet straight onto the hot stone, sheet or tray in the oven. Bake for 8-10 mins until the topping is bubbling and the base is crisp. Remove from the oven and repeat with the second ball of dough."
