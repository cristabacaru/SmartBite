# SmartBite

SmartBite is an interactive Python application designed to help users achieve their weight goals and manage their daily nutrition. By collecting user data (age, gender, height, current weight, activity level, and desired weight), the app calculates the daily calorie requirement and recommends personalized recipes. Additionally, SmartBite allows users to input the ingredients they already have at home, and the app will suggest recipes that use as many of those ingredients as possible, minimizing the need to buy extra ingredients.

# Team Contributions

- **Bianca Gorgovan:**
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Created the web scraper that parses recipe and nutritional data into a JSON file.
    - Developed the calorie recommendation calculator and recipe recommendation algorithm.
    - Worked on the filtering by ingredient algorithm, helping to optimize the recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.
  - **Challenges and Solutions:**
    -Encountered difficulties in ensuring the web scraper parses data accurately from different sources. Resolved this by refining the scraping logic      and adding error-handling mechanisms.
    -The calorie recommendation algorithm initially struggled with handling edge cases for certain user inputs. This was solved by introducing more        robust input validation.
    
- **Teodora Sintea:**
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Managed the database and ensured that the information retrieved from the scraper was properly stored in SQLite.
    - Retrieved information from the JSON files generated by the scraper and integrated it into the database.
    - Worked on the filtering by ingredient algorithm and contributed to the logic for suggesting recipes based on available ingredients.
    - Linked the database to the frontend, ensuring data is seamlessly displayed to the user.
  - **Challenges and Solutions:**
    - Faced challenges while linking the database to the frontend, especially when managing data flow between the backend and frontend. Solved this by     improving the Flask routes and data handling methods.
    - There were also issues with optimizing database queries, which were resolved by refining the schema and indexing important fields.
  
- **Cristiana Tabacaru:**
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Managed the frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience and visually appealing interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
    - Worked on linking the frontend to the backend, ensuring that user inputs (e.g., ingredients, goals) were properly processed and reflected in the     app’s output.
    - Contributed to the recipe scraper, helping to gather the necessary data for recipe recommendations.
  - **Challenges and Solutions:**
    - Faced difficulties in ensuring the frontend and backend communicated efficiently, especially with dynamic content. This was solved by using          Flask’s templating engine and AJAX to update parts of the page dynamically.
    - The recipe scraper had issues with fetching data from dynamic web pages. Overcame this by using Selenium in combination with BeautifulSoup for       more reliable data extraction.
