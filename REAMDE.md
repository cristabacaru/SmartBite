# SmartBite

SmartBite is an interactive Python application designed to help users achieve their weight goals and manage their daily nutrition. By collecting user data (age, gender, height, current weight, activity level, and desired weight), the app calculates the daily calorie requirement and recommends personalized recipes. Additionally, SmartBite allows users to input the ingredients they already have at home, and the app will suggest recipes that use as many of those ingredients as possible, minimizing the need to buy extra ingredients.
